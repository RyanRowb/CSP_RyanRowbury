        <h1 id="title">Hunting</h1>
        <h3>The Start</h3>
        <p><i>As a wee little lad</i>, I was taught that hunting was an important way to prove yourself as a man. <br> I still feel that point stands, and that hunting is one of the best options of recreation their is. <br> It bring you closer to your foodsource.</p>

        <h3>Why I continue?</h3>
        <p>I find it fun to connect with nature and enjoy my freedom as an american. The fundimental belief <br> that hunting is "evil" is based upon wrong set morals. I ask you would you rather have less biodiversity,<br> more starvation (in animals), and more invasive/domintant species taking over your local scenery?</p>
        <h3>The Joys of Hunting</h3>
        <p>Hunting allows you to connect with your primal ancestors, and feel the roots of your life. Hunting also <br>alows you to see where some of your food comes from. Often we forget that the meat at the market isn't <br> just meat, it was an animal. Some people find this hard to swallow, they don't want to accept that for <br> human beings to live, animals must die. Hunting allows you to see that and respect the animals that <br>allow you to live.</p>

        <p>To recap, hunting allows you to</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Realize where your food is coming from</li>
            <li>Connect with nature</li>
            <li>Help you get outdoors</li>
            <li>Teach important life lessons</li>
            <li>Help you connect with your roots</li>
            <li>and more!</li>

        <h1>History is the best</h1>
        <h2>Why history?</h2>
        <p>History is a great way to explore and learn from the past so that <br> we can avoid repeating past mistakes. It allows us to take what <br>previous people did wrong, and not redo it. Of course some people <br>don't listen to history so it is often forget, repeated, and sworn to <br>not be forgten again (which it does anyways)</p>
        <h2>But why is it the best?</h2>
        <p>You learn in it and it is a great source of deep thinking. Just as <br>the sworn enenimies of Leo Chimpan said, "You might destory <br> our books, but you won't destory our history."</p>

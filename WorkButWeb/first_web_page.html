        <h1>Hunting</h1>
        <h3>The Start</h3>
        <p><i>As a wee little lad</i>, I was taught that hunting was an important way to prove yourself as a man. <br> I still feel that point stands, and that hunting is one of the best options of recreation their is. <br> It bring you closer to your foodsource.</p>
        <h3>Why I continue?</h3>
        <p>I find it fun to connect with nature and enjoy my freedom as an american. The fundimental belief <br> that hunting is "evil" is based upon wrong set morals. I ask you would you rather have less biodiversity,<br> more starvation (in animals), and more invasive/domintant species taking over your local scenery?</p>

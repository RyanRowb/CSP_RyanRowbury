            <p><i>As a wee little lad</i>, I was taught that hunting was an important way to prove yourself as a man. <br> I still feel that point stands, and that hunting is one of the best options of recreation their is. <br> It bring you closer to your foodsource.</p>

            <h2>Why I continue?</h2>
            <p>I find it fun to connect with nature and enjoy my freedom as an american. The fundimental belief <br> that hunting is "evil" is based upon wrong set morals. I ask you would you rather have less biodiversity,<br> more starvation (in animals), and more invasive/dominant species taking over your local scenery?</p>
            <h2>The Joys of Hunting</h2>
            <p>Hunting allows you to connect with your primal ancestors, and feel the roots of your life. Hunting also <br>alows you to see where some of your food comes from. Often we forget that the meat at the market isn't <br> just meat, it was an animal. Some people find this hard to swallow, they don't want to accept that for <br> human beings to live, animals must die. Hunting allows you to see that and respect the animals that <br>allow you to live.</p>
